What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a new .git folder gets created that will keep track of all the changes you made
to the files in the repository you decided to follow.
You have to first initialize a repository before you can make commits to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory contains all the files you're working on, as well as the repository.
The repository is a hidden folder than keeps track of the changes you made to the files.
However to do so you need to make regular commits to it.
Commits are like snapshots of the states of some files in your working directory.
Before committing anything to a repository, you need to first add files to the staging area.
The staging area thus allows you to carefully select the files of which you want to keep track together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By selecting the files which contains the logical change and only putting those in the staging area
