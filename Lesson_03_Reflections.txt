When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository offers many advantages:
It allows for collaboration between multiple computers (i.e. multiple collaborators, or one person
working from multiple computers).
It also saves your work in a remote place, so that if your computer crashes, your content is 
safely stored in the repo.
Finally, it allows you to share your project with anyone interested.
